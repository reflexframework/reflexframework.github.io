{% block type='battlecard' text='Scenario' %}
An attacker, "Maligna," identifies a popular but dormant Python library, `py-formatter-util`, which is a dependency in thousands of projects, including a widely used open-source data science toolkit. The library hasn't been updated in four years. Maligna discovers the original maintainer's personal domain, listed in their GitHub profile, has expired.

Maligna purchases the lapsed domain, sets up an email address, and uses the "forgot password" feature on the PyPI package registry to take control of the `py-formatter-util` package. They copy the original source code, add a subtle backdoor that exfiltrates `AWS_` environment variables to their server via a DNS request, and publish it as a new "patch" version (e.g., `1.2.1` -> `1.2.2`).

The next time the data science toolkit's CI/CD pipeline runs a routine dependency update, it automatically pulls in the malicious version `1.2.2`. The compromise is now embedded in the toolkit. When a developer at a tech company uses the updated toolkit on their laptop, the malicious code silently sends their temporary AWS credentials to Maligna's server, giving the attacker access to the company's cloud environment.

### Explanation
This is the attacker's planning phase. They aren't launching a direct assault but are quietly searching for weak links in the open-source supply chain. They methodically scan package ecosystems like PyPI, npm, or Maven Central for popular libraries that show signs of neglect. Their goal is to find a package that is widely trusted but poorly maintained, creating a perfect Trojan horse.

Key tactics include:
*   **Scanning for Dormant Projects:** Using APIs to find packages with no updates for several years but with high download counts or many dependents.
*   **Investigating Maintainers:** Looking up maintainer profiles on GitHub or social media to see if they are still active.
*   **Checking for Lapsed Domains:** Cross-referencing maintainer email addresses with domain `WHOIS` records to find expired domains that can be purchased to intercept password reset emails.
*   **Identifying Namespace Opportunities:** In ecosystems like npm, looking for cases where a popular package name is retired, allowing them to republish a malicious package under the same trusted name.

### Insight
This is a patient, research-driven attack. The attacker exploits the community's trust and the natural lifecycle of software, where projects are often abandoned as developers move on. For a developer, it's a reminder that a dependency isn't just code; it's a relationship with a maintainer whose security posture is now part of your own.

### Practical
*   Periodically review your project's core dependencies. Go to their source repositories. Is the project archived? When was the last commit or release?
*   Be extra cautious with dependencies maintained by a single person ("bus factor" of one).
*   If you maintain a popular package, ensure your recovery email on the package registry is tied to a secure, active domain you control, and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

### Tools/Techniques
*   **Package Health Checkers:** Tools like [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev), [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/), or the [OpenSSF Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) project can analyze dependency health, highlighting unmaintained packages.
*   **API Scripting:** A simple Python or Node.js script can hit the [npm registry API](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md) or [PyPI API](https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/) to check the `time.modified` field for your project's dependencies.
*   **WHOIS tools:** Command-line `whois` or web-based lookups can be used to check the status of a maintainer's domain if you are suspicious.

### Metrics/Signal
*   **Dependency Staleness:** Percentage of direct dependencies in your project that have not been updated in over 18-24 months.
*   **Maintainer Activity:** Number of dependencies whose source repositories have had no commit activity in over a year.

{% block type='battlecard' text='Evaluation' %}
### Explanation
This stage is about looking inward. A developer or team needs to assess their own project's susceptibility to this kind of hijack. It involves a deep analysis of not just the direct dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` or `package.json`, but the entire dependency tree, including the dependencies of your dependencies (transitive dependencies). You must also evaluate the processes and tools used to manage these dependencies.

### Insight
Your project's attack surface is the sum of all its dependencies. A tiny, forgotten utility three levels deep in your dependency graph, if hijacked, can compromise your entire application. Many teams only scrutinize direct dependencies, ignoring the massive, hidden risk in the transitive graph.

### Practical
*   **Generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Create a complete inventory of every single component in your application.
*   **Audit Your Dependency Tree:** With the SBOM, manually or automatically review the health of critical and transitive dependencies. Ask questions: Who maintains this? When was it last updated? Does it have known vulnerabilities?
*   **Review Your Build Process:** Do you use lockfiles? Do you cache dependencies insecurely? Could a compromised package from one build poison the cache for another?

### Tools/Techniques
*   **SBOM Generators:** Tools like [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) (from image/filesystem) or [CycloneDX CLI](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli) (from package manifests) can generate a comprehensive SBOM.
*   **Dependency Scanners:** [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/) or commercial tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [Mend](https://www.mend.io/) can scan your dependency tree and flag unmaintained or vulnerable packages.
*   **In-depth Analysis:** [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev) and [Phylum](https://phylum.io) go further by analyzing package behavior, such as use of `install` scripts, network access, or file system access during installation.

### Metrics/Signal
*   **SBOM Coverage:** Percentage of your production applications that have an up-to-date SBOM.
*   **Transitive Risk Score:** An aggregated score based on the number of unmaintained, vulnerable, or single-maintainer packages in your full dependency graph.

{% block type='battlecard' text='Fortify' %}
### Explanation
Fortification is about building proactive defenses to prevent a hijacked package from entering your system in the first place. This involves establishing strict rules for dependency management and securing the build pipeline itself. The goal is to move from a reactive "scan for vulnerabilities" posture to a proactive "vet what you let in" model.

### Insight
The most effective defense is to have multiple layers. Relying on just one technique (like vulnerability scanning) is fragile. Combining dependency pinning, source analysis, and curated registries creates a much stronger barrier, forcing an attacker to defeat multiple mechanisms.

### Practical
*   **Pin Your Dependencies:** Always use a lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`). This ensures that you always install the exact same version of every package, preventing an unexpected "patch" update from introducing malicious code.
*   **Vet New Dependencies:** Before adding a new library, conduct a brief review. Check its maintenance status, number of contributors, and any strange code patterns (e.g., obfuscated code, unusual `install` scripts).
*   **Use a Private Registry/Proxy:** Host a private registry (like Artifactory or Nexus) that acts as a curated proxy to public ones. You can approve or "bless" specific versions of packages, and your build systems will only pull from this trusted source.
*   **(For Maintainers) Secure Your Own Packages:** Enable 2FA on your npm/PyPI/Maven account. Use a strong, unique password. Do not link your account to a personal, easily-losable domain.

### Tools/Techniques
*   **Lockfiles:** These are built into modern package managers like `npm`, `yarn`, `pipenv`, and `poetry`. Ensure they are committed to your source control.
*   **Private Registries:** [JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/), [Sonatype Nexus Repository](https://www.sonatype.com/products/nexus-repository), and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) can be configured to proxy and cache public packages.
*   **Policy-as-Code:** Use tools like [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) in your CI pipeline to enforce rules, e.g., "block any dependency that has not been updated in 3 years" or "require a security team approval label on the PR for any new dependency addition."

### Metrics/Signal
*   **Lockfile Enforcement:** 100% of projects in CI must have an up-to-date lockfile.
*   **Vetted Dependency Ratio:** Percentage of dependencies in your private registry that have been explicitly approved.

{% block type='battlecard' text='Limit' %}
### Explanation
This stage assumes the attacker has succeeded; a malicious package is now running within your system. The focus shifts to containment, or limiting the "blast radius." The goal is to ensure that even if the malicious code executes, it can do minimal damage because it's running in a restrictive, low-privilege environment.

### Insight
The principle of least privilege is your most powerful tool here. A compromised build script should not be able to access production database credentials. A compromised web server should not be able to scan your internal network. By treating every process, especially those in your CI/CD pipeline, as potentially hostile, you can dramatically reduce the impact of a successful breach.

### Practical
*   **Isolate Build Steps:** Run each step of your CI/CD pipeline in a separate, ephemeral container that is destroyed afterward.
*   **Restrict Network Access:** By default, deny all outbound network traffic from your build agents. Only allow connections to specific, known resources like your package registry or artifact store.
*   **Use Short-Lived Credentials:** Never store long-lived `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`s as secrets in your CI system. Instead, use mechanisms like OIDC federation to grant the CI job a temporary, scoped-down token that expires a few minutes after the job completes.

### Tools/Techniques
*   **Ephemeral CI Runners:** Use services like [GitHub Actions hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) or configure self-hosted runners to run each job in a fresh [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.
*   **Network Policies:** If running builds on Kubernetes, use [Kubernetes Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) to control traffic flow. For VMs, use firewall rules or security groups.
*   **Short-Lived Credentials:** Use [AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-fine-grained-iam-roles-for-service-accounts/), [Google Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity), or [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to issue temporary credentials.

### Metrics/Signal
*   **Credential TTL:** The maximum Time-To-Live for credentials issued to CI jobs is less than 60 minutes.
*   **Egress Traffic Rules:** Number of "allow any" outbound network rules from build environments (should be zero).

{% block type='battlecard' text='Expose' %}
### Explanation
Expose is about making the invisible visible. How do you detect that a hijacked package is active in your environment? This requires robust logging, monitoring, and alerting on anomalies in your build pipeline and running applications. You are looking for signs of malicious behavior that deviate from the expected baseline.

### Insight
Attackers often try to hide their activity, but they almost always leave traces. A malicious package needs to communicate with its C2 server, access sensitive files, or execute unexpected processes. These are the signals you need to capture. The key is to monitor the *behavior* of your software supply chain, not just the code itself.

### Practical
*   **Monitor Build Process Behavior:** Log all network connections, file system access, and process executions that occur during your CI builds. Alert on any suspicious activity, especially network calls to unknown domains.
*   **Monitor Runtime Behavior:** In production, monitor for similar anomalies. A web application that suddenly spawns a shell (`/bin/sh`) or tries to connect to a raw IP address is a major red flag.
*   **Audit Package Metadata Changes:** Set up alerts for when a dependency is updated and its maintainer list changes, or when its source repository URL changes. This is a strong signal of a potential takeover.

### Tools/Techniques
*   **Behavioral Analysis:** [Phylum](https://phylum.io) and [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev) analyze and flag suspicious behavior *before* you install a package (e.g., `postinstall` scripts that make network calls).
*   **Runtime Threat Detection:** Tools like [Falco](https://falco.org/) or [Tetragon](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon) use eBPF to monitor syscalls at the kernel level and can detect suspicious runtime behavior (e.g., "Sensitive file opened by non-trusted program").
*   **Log Aggregation & SIEM:** Centralize logs from your CI systems and applications into a tool like [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), or an open-source [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack). Create alerts for specific suspicious events.
*   **Dependency Webhooks:** Some package registries offer webhooks or RSS feeds that can be used to monitor changes to packages you depend on.

### Metrics/Signal
*   **Anomalous Egress Alert:** An alert is triggered for any network connection from a build agent to a domain not on an allowlist.
*   **Maintainer Change Alert:** An alert is triggered when a `git diff` of your lockfile shows a new author or repository URL for an existing package.

{% block type='battlecard' text='eXercise' %}
### Explanation
This stage is about proactive practice. You can't wait for a real attack to test your defenses. By running regular security exercises and drills, developers build the "muscle memory" needed to identify and respond to a supply chain attack quickly and effectively. It’s about turning theory into practice.

### Insight
A security policy or tool is useless if no one knows how it works or what to do when it fires an alert. Exercises reveal the gaps in your processes, tooling, and training in a low-stakes environment, allowing you to fix them before a real incident occurs.

### Practical
*   **Tabletop Exercise:** Gather the development and security teams. Present them with the scenario: "Dependabot just updated a package, and our monitoring has flagged a suspicious outbound connection from the build server. What do you do, step by step?"
*   **Live Fire Drill (Red Team):** Create a benign "malicious" package and publish it to your private registry. Have a developer add it to a test application. See if your automated systems (CI checks, runtime monitoring) catch it. If not, why? If they do, did the on-call developer follow the correct incident response runbook?
*   **Capture the Flag (CTF):** Create a fun, competitive event where developers are given a container or application with a compromised dependency and have to use the available tools (logs, monitors) to find the backdoor.

### Tools/Techniques
*   **Incident Response Runbooks:** Document your process for handling a supply chain compromise in a tool like [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) or a simple Markdown file in a Git repo. The exercise is to follow the runbook precisely.
*   **Benign "Malicious" Packages:** You can create a simple package that, for example, runs `curl https://<internal-test-domain>/compromised` in a `postinstall` script. This simulates network exfiltration without causing real harm.
*   **Internal Training:** Use the results of these exercises to create short, targeted training modules for developers on topics like "How to vet a new dependency" or "What to do when a Falco alert fires."

### Metrics/Signal
*   **Mean Time To Detect (MTTD):** In an exercise, how long does it take from the "malicious" code being committed until the first alert is triggered?
*   **Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR):** How long does it take to identify the malicious package, create a PR to remove/revert it, and get it deployed to production?
*   **Developer Confidence Score:** Periodically survey developers on their confidence in handling a security incident related to a dependency.
