**Reduce the blast radius.**

Even the best defences sometimes fail. Limit is about **containing damage and ensuring graceful recovery**.

- **For developers**: Add feature flags and kill-switches for risky features. Partition data access with RBAC. Implement circuit breakers and rate limiting.
- **For leaders**: Limiting impact reduces downtime, legal exposure, and brand damage. It makes the difference between a minor incident and a headline breach.

**Pitch point:** Limiting damage is cost-effective resilience. It allows businesses to recover faster and with less reputational harm when something does go wrong.
