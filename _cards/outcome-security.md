REFLEX provides a developer-first methodology that bridges the gap between AppSec and engineering, turning security policies into hands-on practices that developers adopt, reducing shadow risk and improving overall security posture.

Policies donâ€™t protect systems unless developers use them. REFLEX translates high-level security goals into hands-on practices that fit seamlessly into developer and DevOps workflows. By aligning developer behavior with security controls, REFLEX reduces shadow risk, lowers the chance of supply chain compromise, and makes your security posture measurable and defensible.
