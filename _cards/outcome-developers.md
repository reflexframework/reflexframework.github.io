By applying REFLEX, you’ll learn how attackers actually target your tools and workflows, practice spotting threats in your everyday environment, and build secure habits that make your code and pipelines resilient—without slowing you down.


You want to write code, not chase security checklists. REFLEX equips you with practical awareness of how attackers target your everyday tools, packages, and workflows. You’ll learn to spot risky dependencies, protect your environment, and adopt secure habits without slowing down your delivery. With REFLEX, security becomes a natural part of coding, not an afterthought.
