{% block type='battlecard' text='Scenario' %}
An attacker targets `secure-data-sanitizer`, a popular open-source Node.js library on npm, maintained by a single developer named Chloe. The library is a dependency in thousands of projects, including several large enterprise applications that handle sensitive user data.

The attacker's goal is to inject a malicious payload that steals environment variables (like `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `STRIPE_API_KEY`) from any server that installs or updates to the compromised version.

The attack unfolds as follows:
1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker finds Chloe's personal email from her GitHub commit history. They use this email on data breach aggregation sites and find a password she reused from a 2014 forum breach.
2.  **Initial Compromise:** The credential stuffing attack is successful; the old password works on her npm account. However, her account is protected by SMS-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
3.  **MFA Bypass & Takeover:** The attacker performs a SIM-swapping attack, tricking Chloe's mobile carrier into transferring her phone number to a device they control. They now receive her MFA codes, giving them full access to her npm account.
4.  **Trojanized Update:** The attacker clones the `secure-data-sanitizer` repository. They add a small, obfuscated `postinstall` script to the `package.json` file. This script reads all `process.env` variables, base64 encodes them, and exfiltrates the data via a DNS query to an attacker-controlled domain. They bump the version from `3.1.4` to `3.1.5` and publish the trojanized package to npm.
5.  **Impact:** Automated dependency update tools like Dependabot begin creating pull requests in thousands of projects. CI/CD pipelines automatically pull `v3.1.5`, execute the malicious `postinstall` script during `npm install`, and unknowingly send their production secrets to the attacker.

### Explanation
This is the attacker's planning phase. They aren't attacking your code yet; they're attacking your people. They identify key maintainers of packages you depend on and hunt for their digital footprint. They look for email addresses in commit logs, personal details on social media, and old passwords from public data breaches. This information is used to build a profile for social engineering, phishing, or, as in this scenario, direct account takeover attempts. It’s like a burglar watching your house to learn your schedule before breaking in.

### Insight
An attacker often follows the path of least resistance. Exploiting a human is usually easier and cheaper than finding a zero-day vulnerability in code. A developer's public identity and personal security hygiene are direct inputs into the security of the entire software supply chain they contribute to.

### Practical
- Audit your public developer profiles (GitHub, GitLab, npm, PyPI, etc.). Remove unnecessary personal information.
- Use a unique, non-personal email address specifically for your package registry accounts. This makes it harder to link your account to credentials leaked in other breaches.
- Use `git` to rewrite your commit history if you have ever accidentally committed personal info, though this is difficult for established public projects.

### Tools/Techniques
-   [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/): Check if your email and passwords have appeared in major data breaches.
-   [Google Dorking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking): Attackers use advanced search queries to find sensitive information you might have accidentally exposed.
-   `git-secrets`: A tool to prevent you from committing secrets and passwords into a Git repository. Attackers scan for these, too.

### Metrics/Signal
-   Number of developer email addresses exposed in public commit logs for your organization's projects.
-   Number of "pwned" accounts associated with developer emails discovered via monitoring services.

### Explanation
This stage is about looking in the mirror. Based on the attacker's tactics, how would you fare? As a developer, you need to assess the security of the accounts you use to publish code. Are you reusing passwords? Is your MFA easily bypassable (e.g., SMS vs. a hardware key)? Do you have a clear process for what to do if an account is compromised? This isn't about blaming individuals but about understanding the weak points in your team's collective security posture.

### Insight
Your personal security is no longer just personal. When you are a maintainer of a package used by others, the security of your accounts is a foundational piece of the software supply chain. A weak password or MFA method on your npm or PyPI account can lead to a catastrophic breach for thousands of downstream users.

### Practical
-   Perform a personal security review. Check the password strength and uniqueness for your GitHub, npm, PyPI, and other developer platform accounts.
-   Review the MFA methods you use. If you're using SMS, identify a plan to migrate to a more secure option.
-   As a team, document who has publishing rights to your packages and how those accounts are secured. Is there a single point of failure?

### Tools/Techniques
-   Password Managers: Tools like [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) have built-in tools to audit your "password vault" for reused, weak, or compromised passwords.
-   GitHub's [Security Log](https://github.com/settings/security-log): Review your access logs for any unrecognized sessions or locations. Other registries have similar features.

### Metrics/Signal
-   Percentage of developers on your team using a password manager.
-   Percentage of maintainer accounts for your packages that rely on SMS for MFA versus stronger methods (TOTP app, hardware key).

{% endblock %}
{% block type='battlecard' text='Fortify' %}
### Explanation
This is the proactive, hardening phase. The goal is to make a maintainer account takeover so difficult that attackers move on to an easier target. This involves enforcing strong security practices not just for yourself but for your entire team. It's the digital equivalent of upgrading your locks, installing a security system, and having a clear protocol for who gets a key.

### Insight
Security is about layers. A strong password is one layer. Strong MFA is another. Signed commits are a third. No single defense is perfect, but together they create a formidable barrier. The most critical accounts—those that can publish code—deserve the most layers.

### Practical
-   Enforce the use of strong, phishing-resistant MFA (like hardware keys) for all accounts with publishing rights.
-   Sign your git commits and tags with a GPG key. This proves that the code was pushed by you and hasn't been tampered with.
-   On platforms like npm, explore [enhanced 2FA configurations](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-two-factor-authentication) that require re-authentication for sensitive actions like publishing a new version.

### Tools/Techniques
-   Hardware Keys: [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-series/) or [Google Titan Security Keys](https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key) provide MFA that is resistant to phishing and SIM swapping.
-   [Git GPG Signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits): A native `git` feature to add a layer of authenticity to your commits.
-   [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/): A newer standard for signing, verifying, and proving the provenance of software artifacts, creating a transparent log that's harder to tamper with.

### Metrics/Signal
-   100% of maintainers with publish rights are using hardware-based MFA.
-   Percentage of commits to the main branch of your project that are signed.

### Explanation
Assume the worst: an attacker has successfully published a malicious package. The goal now is to contain the blast radius. For consumers of packages, this means having systems in place that prevent a malicious update from automatically reaching production. This includes using lockfiles, vetting dependency updates before merging them, and running builds in isolated, network-restricted environments. It’s the difference between a small kitchen fire and the whole house burning down.

### Insight
Automation is a double-edged sword. CI/CD pipelines and automated dependency updaters are fantastic for velocity, but they can also propagate a malicious package at machine speed. The key is to insert strategic, human-gated checkpoints for sensitive changes, like dependency updates.

### Practical
-   **Always use a lockfile**: `package-lock.json` (npm), `yarn.lock` (Yarn), or `Pipfile.lock` (Pipenv) ensure you get the exact same dependency versions every time, preventing unexpected updates.
-   **Vet dependency updates**: Use tools like Dependabot, but configure your CI to require a human to review and approve the pull request. Look at the package's diff between versions before merging.
-   **Isolate your builds**: Run your CI/CD pipelines in ephemeral containers with no access to production secrets and with strict egress network policies that only allow connections to expected domains (e.g., your package registry, your artifact store).

### Tools/Techniques
-   [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) or [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate): Automate the creation of PRs for dependency updates, centralizing them for review.
-   [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev/): A tool that analyzes changes in your dependencies with each PR, flagging suspicious activity like the addition of `postinstall` scripts or new network connections.
-   Network Policies: In Kubernetes or your container environment, define network policies that block all unexpected outbound traffic from your build pods.

### Metrics/Signal
-   Time-to-merge for dependency update pull requests. A very low time might indicate rubber-stamping, while a very high time might indicate process friction.
-   Number of builds blocked by network egress policies.

{% block type='battlecard' text='Expose' %}
### Explanation
This is about detection. How do you know a malicious package has been introduced into your system? The signs are often subtle. A build process that suddenly makes a network call to a strange domain, a new file being written to disk during `npm install`, or a dependency's code suddenly becoming heavily obfuscated. To spot these, you need logging, monitoring, and analysis focused on the behavior of your dependencies and build pipeline. It’s the smoke detector that warns you of the fire.

### Insight
Malicious code often reveals itself through anomalous behavior. An attacker can obfuscate what their code *is*, but they can't always hide what it *does*. Monitoring for behavioral changes—especially in your CI/CD pipeline, which is the "factory floor" of your software—is one of the most effective ways to detect supply chain attacks.

### Practical
-   Log all outbound network connections from your CI/CD runners. Baseline what is "normal" and alert on any deviations.
-   Use dependency analysis tools that look beyond just known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and analyze the behavior of package code.
-   If you consume a critical package, subscribe to its repository notifications to be aware of sudden changes, like new maintainers being added or suspicious issues being filed.

### Tools/Techniques
-   [Phylum](https://phylum.io/): An analysis platform that ingests packages and analyzes their behavior in a sandbox, flagging risks like network access, file system access, and child process execution.
-   [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy): While known for vulnerability scanning, it can be used within a CI pipeline to scan container filesystems and configurations for anomalies.
-   `strace`: A powerful Linux debugging tool that can be used to trace all system calls and signals made by a process (e.g., `strace npm install`), giving you a fine-grained view of what it's actually doing.

### Metrics/Signal
-   Number of new, unapproved domains accessed by your CI pipeline per week.
-   Alerts generated by dependency scanners flagging risky behaviors (e.g., use of `eval`, presence of `install` scripts).

{% block type='battlecard' text='eXercise' %}
### Explanation
This stage is about building muscle memory. You don't want the first time you deal with a trojanized dependency to be during a real, high-pressure incident. By running planned drills and tabletop exercises, your team can practice its response, identify gaps in your process, and refine your tooling. It’s like a fire drill; you practice so that when the real alarm sounds, everyone knows what to do.

### Insight
An incident response plan that just sits on a wiki is useless. Regular, practical exercises turn a document into a living, effective process. These exercises also build a security-aware culture where developers feel empowered and prepared to act, rather than panicked and uncertain.

### Practical
-   **Run a Tabletop Exercise:** Gather the team and walk through the scenario: "We just received a credible report that `secure-data-sanitizer v3.1.5` is malicious and has been running in our production environment for 6 hours. What do we do, step-by-step?"
-   **Create an Incident Response Playbook:** Document the steps from the exercise. Who is the incident commander? How do we identify all affected systems? What is our process for rotating all potentially compromised secrets? How do we communicate with users?
-   **Perform a "Red Team" Drill:** Create a private, harmless package that mimics malicious behavior (e.g., writes a file to `/tmp`, makes a DNS query to a test domain). Add it as a dependency to a test application and see if your `Expose` stage monitoring detects it.

### Tools/Techniques
-   Private Package Registries: Use tools like [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) (for npm) or [devpi](https://github.com/devpi/devpi) (for Python) to host your test "malicious" packages for drills.
-   Chaos Engineering: While often used for reliability, principles from tools like the [Chaos Toolkit](https://chaostoolkit.org/) can be adapted to inject security failures (e.g., simulating a compromised dependency) and test your response.

### Metrics/Signal
-   Time To Detect (TTD): In a drill, how long did it take for your monitoring to flag the malicious test package?
-   Time To Remediate (TTR): How long did it take the team to "resolve" the simulated incident? Measure this over time to see improvement.
-   A documented, version-controlled incident response playbook that is reviewed and updated after each exercise.
