## Agenda

### 0:00 – 0:15 | Welcome & Scene-Setting
- The AI landscape: opportunities and competitive pressures.
- The parallel rise of AI-enabled cybercrime.
- Why AI governance and supply chain security belong together.

**Takeaway:** AI adoption is a business resilience decision, not just a tech one.


### 0:15 – 0:35 | Fact-Finding: AI in Your Business *(Interactive)*
- Quick mapping exercise: where AI is used (or planned).
- Identify drivers: efficiency, customer experience, compliance.
- Spot gaps: shadow AI use, vendor risk, missing governance.

**Takeaway:** Shared understanding of the current AI adoption footprint.



### 0:35 – 1:05 | Step into the Attacker’s Shoes *(Perspective Shift)*
- Real-world AI risks: poisoned models, data leakage, prompt injection, supply chain compromise.
- Group exercise: *“If you were an attacker, how would you exploit AI in your org?”*
- Cluster responses into themes: data, trust, regulation, supply chain.

**Takeaway:** AI risk is both an external threat and an internal governance challenge.


### 1:05 – 1:30 | REFLEX Framework for AI
- How each REFLEX stage applies:
    - **Reconnaissance** → spotting AI use and exposure.
    - **Evaluation** → assessing vendors, dependencies, and models.
    - **Fortify** → secure development and deployment practices.
    - **Limit** → governance, access control, and data boundaries.
    - **Expose** → monitoring model behavior and drift.
    - **eXecute** → incident response and regulatory readiness.
- Map earlier “attack surface” findings into REFLEX.

**Takeaway:** A structured, repeatable model for secure AI adoption.



### 1:30 – 1:55 | Strategic Actions & Roadmap *(Collaborative)*
- Define 3–4 **priority moves** (e.g., AI policy, vendor evaluation, compliance readiness).
- Identify quick wins vs. long-term initiatives.
- Clarify leadership’s role in accountability and culture.

**Takeaway:** A practical business-level action plan anchored in REFLEX.


### 1:55 – 2:00 | Wrap-Up & Commitments
- Each exec shares one action they’ll take in the next 30 days.
- Provide takeaway materials:
    - AI + REFLEX cheat sheet
    - Regulatory checklist
    - “Questions to ask your teams” guide

**Final Message:** Secure AI adoption is a leadership choice, not just a technical one.
