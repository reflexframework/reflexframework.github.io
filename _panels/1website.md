I've been working on this website for a while now. I regularly speaking at conferences and writing articles, giving workshops, and teaching developers about the aspects to security they often miss. That's software supply chain security.  I'm hoping to share some of my knowledge and experiences with you vis the website.  It's a collection of articles, talks, and other resources brought together under a common banner = that of REFLEX.

My hope is that this website will help you understand the challenges and opportunities of software supply chain security and how to apply it to your own projects.  I hope you enjoy it.
