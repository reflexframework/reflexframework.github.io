title:  A Practical Framework for Secure Software Development
collection: stages
description: Core reference for each stage of REFLEX.
---

Every stage of the software lifecycle is a potential attack surface. From the first line of code to the final deployment in production.  

REFLEX is a developer-focused framework that helps teams **think like attackers, defend like professionals, and respond like leaders.**

It works across two audiences:
- **Developers**: hands-on guidance on where to look, what to fix, and how to build securely by default.
- **C-suite leaders**: strategic assurance that teams are adopting practices that reduce risk, improve compliance, and prepare the business for regulatory and reputational challenges.

Security doesn’t happen by accident. With REFLEX, developers learn how attackers work, leaders see measurable resilience, and organisations stay one step ahead.

REFLEX stands for **Reconnaissance, Evaluate, Fortify, Limit, Expose, eXercise.**  
Let’s walk through each stage.
