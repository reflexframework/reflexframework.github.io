REFLEX equips you with practical defenses for CI/CD and infrastructure pipelines, showing how to detect and block supply chain compromises before they reach production, while proving compliance with security standards.


Your pipelines are the backbone of delivery â€” and a prime target for attackers. REFLEX helps you harden CI/CD workflows, protect secrets, and verify every artifact that moves from code to production. The framework aligns pipeline automation with regulatory needs, so you can deliver at speed while preventing compromised builds from ever reaching production.
