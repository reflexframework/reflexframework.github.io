**Apply attacker knowledge to your own environment.**

Once you understand how reconnaissance works, the next step is to **assess where you’re vulnerable**. Developers can map attacker techniques directly to their systems and workflows.

- **For developers**: Perform SBOM analysis. Identify unmaintained dependencies. Threat-model critical flows (authentication, file uploads, deployments). Run a “blast radius” exercise: what if your publish token was stolen?
- **For leaders**: Evaluation translates into measurable risk awareness. It creates a prioritised list of exposures you can fund, schedule, or report against.

**Pitch point:** This stage turns abstract “security concerns” into concrete, ranked items. That means better ROI on security investments — and fewer surprises.
