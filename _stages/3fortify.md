**Build the defences.**

Fortification is where developers **implement secure defaults and enforceable controls**. The goal isnâ€™t to make attacks impossible, but to raise the cost or difficulty level high enough that attackers move on.

- **For developers**: Secure secrets in vaults. Lock down CI tokens with least privilege. Enforce signed commits and signed artifacts. Add dependency lockfiles and checksum verification.
- **For leaders**: Fortification provides visible, reportable controls. This is where compliance frameworks (CRA, NIS2, EO 14028) expect to see progress.

**Pitch point:** Fortify demonstrates proactive defence. It reassures auditors, investors, and customers that your teams are building on secure foundations.
