**Make attacks visible.**

Undetected attacks are the most expensive. Expose is about **building observability and alerts into your systems**, so you know when something abnormal is happening.

- **For developers**: Ship structured logs with correlation IDs. Alert on suspicious events like unusual artifact publishing or dependency churn. Integrate alerts with runbooks.
- **For leaders**: Expose provides the data that regulators, auditors, and insurers will ask for: what did you see, when did you see it, and what did you do about it?

**Pitch point:** Detection is a competitive advantage. Companies that detect quickly recover faster â€” and prove to stakeholders that they take security seriously.
