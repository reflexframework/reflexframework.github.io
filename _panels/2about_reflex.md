The REFLEX Framework offers a practical, developer-first approach to embedding security awareness, resilience, and response into everyday workflows. REFLEX transforms developers from passive users of security policies into active defenders of their environments, code, and systems.

REFLEX teaches developers how to think like an attacker and how to translate that insight into defensive muscle memory they can apply on a day-to-day basis. 



## Why REFLEX Matters
- **For developers:** it’s a concrete, step-by-step way to bake security into everyday coding, not an afterthought.
- **For leaders:** it’s a framework that aligns developer action with business resilience, compliance, and reputation.

REFLEX isn’t another abstract model. It’s a **practical discipline that improves both code quality and organisational trust**.
