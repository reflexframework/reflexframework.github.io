A battlecard is a concise, structured reference that captures everything a developer, security engineer, or decision-maker needs to know about a specific vulnerability or attack technique. **Its purpose is to:**

-- **Summarize the threat clearly:**  what it is, how it works, and why it matters.

-- **Map the attacker’s playbook:** showing how the vulnerability is exploited, from reconnaissance to impact.

-- **Highlight defensive actions:** prevention, detection, and response steps developers can take immediately.

-- **Support demos and training:** providing practical scenarios and “what if” exercises that bring the vulnerability to life.

-- **Enable fast decision-making:** giving both technical and non-technical stakeholders a quick grasp of business risks and priorities.

Put simply: a battlecard is the developer’s cheat-sheet for surviving an attack scenario. It compresses complex research into an easy-to-consume format, so teams can learn, defend, and practice without wading through pages of unstructured reports.

For developers, the purpose of a battlecard is to compress research into an actionable playbook that makes it easier to spot, prevent, and respond to real-world attacks during day-to-day coding and operations.

For executives, the purpose of a battlecard is to translate technical threats into business risks and priorities, enabling informed decisions about investment, readiness, and response.
