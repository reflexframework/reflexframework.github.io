**Practise until secure thinking is muscle memory.**

The final step is cultural. You don’t want the first time your team responds to an incident to be when the real one hits.  
Exercise means **tabletop drills, chaos experiments, and attack simulations** — so both devs and leaders know what to do when the alarms sound.

- **For developers**: Run 90-minute tabletop scenarios. Test kill-switches. Simulate malicious package injections. Learn where runbooks break.
- **For leaders**: Exercises provide confidence. They show that the organisation isn’t just compliant on paper — it can actually respond under pressure.

**Pitch point:** Exercising builds resilience into people as well as systems. It creates trust with customers, regulators, and investors.
